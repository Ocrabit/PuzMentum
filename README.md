# PuzMentum

PuzMentum is a momentum-based puzzle game built around a simple core idea: you control a rolling ball that leaves behind after-images. These after-images trigger different gimmicks throughout each level, and by placing them strategically, you can unlock new areas, activate switches, and reach keys that allow you to progress.

The game blends physics-driven movement with puzzle solving, forcing you to think about momentum, positioning, and timing all at once.

PuzMentum was built in **Unity**, and the project gave me a great chance to sharpen my **C#** skills while experimenting with puzzle design and fun mechanics. It was a creative challenge and allowed me to exercise more of the artistic side of my skill set (I am no artist by any standards, but creativity is always a blast)
